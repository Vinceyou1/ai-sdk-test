I created this project to test some of the features Vercel's AI SDK exposes, like:
- Streaming text
- Conversation history
- System prompts
- Structured output
- File attachments (image/pdf)
- Tool calling
- Generative UI

If you want to run this project locally, make sure to obtain a [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat), as well as a [Weather API key](https://www.weatherapi.com/) for tool calling, and put them in your .env file.

Created using the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/), [Next.js/React](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), and [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
